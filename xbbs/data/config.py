    """Configuration for ``xbstrap-mirror``.  Allows the coordinator to provide mirrors of
    source repositories the ``xbstrap`` distro uses.  A good bit of courtesy we should
    all strive to do.

    This feature is not enabled by default, as it requires extra setup outside of the
    coordinator.  The coordinator can't actually serve Git repositories.  If one wishes
    to use this feature (highly recommended), they will need to do some extra setup.

    The coordinator will run ``xbstrap-mirror`` in order to update a *mirror build*.
    The mirror build is a special build directory containing only directories in format
    ``mirrors/${vcs}/${source_name}`` that contain mirrors of upstream source
    repositories.

    Currently, ``xbstrap`` can only mirror Git repositories, so ``vcs`` is usually
    ``git``.

    The administrator should expose this ``mirrors/`` directory structure via
    appropriate VCS-specific tools on some endpoint accessible by all workers.  This
    endpoint is called the *mirror base URL*.  This requires extra configuration; the
    following is an example snippet of nginx_ configuration that exposes a mirror build
    at ``/var/lib/xbbs/mirror_build`` at base URL
    ``https://mirrors.managarm.org/mirror``::

        server {
                listen 443 ssl http2;
                server_name mirrors.managarm.org;

                location /mirror/git/ {
                        rewrite  ^/mirror/git/(.*) /$1 break;
                        fastcgi_pass  unix:/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
                        include       fastcgi_params;
                        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME     /usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend;
                        fastcgi_param GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL "yes";
                        fastcgi_param GIT_PROJECT_ROOT    /var/lib/xbbs/mirror_build/mirror/git;
                        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO           $uri;
                }
        }

    The mirror build directory can be shared between multiple projects, if they share
    the same sources.  The coordinator will arrange for these directories to be updated
    at the start of the build.

    ``xbbs`` will arrange the provided mirror base URL (in the example above,
    ``https://mirrors.managarm.org/mirror``) to be used for fetching mirrored sources on
    each worker.
